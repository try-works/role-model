def memory_router_body() -> str:

This file is the durable memory router for the repository.
It is not a knowledge dump. Store durable memory in sharded docs under `domains/`, `patterns/`, `incidents/`, `episodes/`, `training/`, `skills/`, or `archive/`.

Control-plane docs are not memory docs:
- `/.recursive/RECURSIVE.md`
- `/.recursive/STATE.md`
- `/.recursive/DECISIONS.md`
- `/.codex/AGENTS.md`
- `/AGENTS.md`
- `/.agent/PLANS.md`

## Retrieval Rules

- Read this file before loading any other memory docs.
- Load only the memory docs relevant to the current task.
- If the task may benefit from prior recursive-mode experiential learnings, use this index to identify the relevant docs under `/.recursive/memory/training/` and `/.recursive/memory/domains/`.
- The optional `recursive-training-sync.py` helper is read-only; it prints startup guidance about what to read, but does not modify `MEMORY.md` or the memory plane.
- If the task plans delegated review, subagent help, review bundles, smoke-harness portability work, or capability-sensitive execution, read `/.recursive/memory/skills/SKILLS.md` and then load the relevant skill-memory shards.
- If Phase 8 will need to promote durable lessons, first capture run-local skill usage in the run artifact and only then promote generalized conclusions into skill-memory shards.
- Prefer `Status: CURRENT` docs for planning and execution.
- `Status: SUSPECT` docs may be used as leads, but revalidate them before trust.
- Exclude `STALE` and `DEPRECATED` docs from default retrieval unless doing historical analysis.

## Registry

- `domains/` - stable functional-area knowledge with `Owns-Paths`
- `patterns/` - reusable playbooks and solution patterns
- `incidents/` - recurring failure signatures and fixes
- `episodes/` - distilled lessons from specific runs
- `training/` - extracted experiential learnings promoted from completed recursive-mode runs
- `skills/` - durable skill and capability memory, routed via `skills/SKILLS.md`
- `archive/` - historical or deprecated memory docs

## Freshness Rules

- Durable memory docs must declare the metadata defined in `references/artifact-template.md`.
- Any doc whose `Owns-Paths` or `Watch-Paths` overlaps final changed code paths must be reviewed in Phase 8.
- Affected `CURRENT` docs should be downgraded to `SUSPECT` until revalidated against final code, `STATE.md`, and `DECISIONS.md`.
- If changed paths have no owning domain doc, create one or record the uncovered-path follow-up in `08-memory-impact.md`.
- Training memory docs should keep their canonical content under `/.recursive/memory/training/`, use the memory index as the discovery surface, and record source runs plus watch-path or applicability guidance.
- Skill-memory docs should record source runs, last validated date, environment notes, and current trust/fit guidance.
- If a run materially teaches the repo something about skill availability, delegated-review quality, review-bundle usage, or toolchain fallback behavior, Phase 8 must either create/refresh a skill-memory shard or record why no durable lesson was promoted.
- If the repo itself is a reusable skill/workflow distribution, durable memory must remain generalized. Do not store current-session run residue or temp-environment observations as if they were universal truth.

- If the run may use delegated review, subagents, or review bundles:

  - read the most relevant availability/usage notes if any have been intentionally promoted into skill memory
- In Phase 8, promote durable skill lessons into one of these shards:
  - `availability/` for capability probes and environment constraints
  - `usage/` for stable fit/use guidance
  - `issues/` for recurring failure modes

# Skill Discovery And Evaluation

Use this guidance when a run needs a specialized capability that is not already available.

## Preferred Order

1. Use the `find-skills` skill if it is already installed.
2. Otherwise use the Skills CLI directly.
3. If nothing suitable exists, proceed with built-in capability and record that no suitable external skill was available.

## Useful Commands

- `npx skills find <query>`
- `npx skills add <package-or-repo>`
- `npx skills add <package-or-repo> --skill <skill-name>`
- `npx skills check`
- `npx skills update`

## Evaluation Rules

- Prefer skills from reputable publishers or organizations.
- Prefer higher install counts when the skills are otherwise comparable.
- Check upstream repository quality before recommending or installing a skill.
- Do not treat search results as proof of quality; verify source and documentation first.

## Phase 8 Recording

If a run materially used skill discovery, capture it in `08-memory-impact.md` under:

- `## Run-Local Skill Usage Capture`
- `## Skill Memory Promotion Review`

Promote only durable, reusable conclusions into skill memory. Leave one-off session notes in the run artifact instead of turning them into durable guidance.

# Delegated Verification And Refresh

Delegated work is optional helper output, not autonomous authority.

## Main-Agent Acceptance Rules

Before accepting meaningful delegated work, the main agent should verify:

- claimed file impact against the actual diff-owned file set
- claimed artifact reads or updates against files that actually exist
- review-bundle contents against the current reviewed artifact and artifact hash
- requirement, plan, addenda, and prior recursive docs that materially informed acceptance
- whether any post-review repair made the delegated context stale

## Record In The Phase Artifact

When delegated work materially contributes, `## Subagent Contribution Verification` should record:

- `Reviewed Action Records`
- `Main-Agent Verification Performed`
- `Acceptance Decision`
- `Refresh Handling`
- `Repair Performed After Verification`

## Refresh Rule

If repairs materially change the reviewed artifact, changed-file scope, or evidence basis, refresh the review bundle or action record before relying on delegated work for lockable evidence.

## Rejection Rule

If the main agent cannot verify delegated claims against actual files, actual artifacts, and the actual diff scope, reject the delegated result and fall back to self-audit for lockable completion evidence.

# Phase 8 Skill Memory Promotion

Skill memory should be operational, not accidental.

## First Capture It Run-Locally

Before promoting durable guidance, record run-local skill usage in `08-memory-impact.md`:

- what skills were available
- what skills were sought
- what skills were attempted or used
- what worked well
- what issues were encountered
- what future guidance changed
- what promotion candidates exist

## Then Decide What Becomes Durable

Promote only lessons that are:

- reusable across runs
- specific enough to change future planning or verification behavior
- not merely one-off environmental noise

## Keep The Boundary Honest

- Run-local observations belong in the run artifact first.
- Durable memory should contain generalized guidance, not session history.
- In reusable skill/workflow repos, do not turn current-session implementation residue into durable memory unless it has been rewritten as generic repository guidance.

- Treat `/.recursive/RECURSIVE.md` as the single workflow source of truth.
- If this file conflicts with `/.recursive/RECURSIVE.md`, follow `/.recursive/RECURSIVE.md`.

## Suggested Read Order

1. Read `/.recursive/RECURSIVE.md` first for workflow rules and required behavior.
2. Read `/.recursive/STATE.md` when the current repo state matters.
3. Read `/.recursive/DECISIONS.md` when prior rationale or relevant earlier work matters.

6. Read the recursive-mode package README or maintainer notes from the installed skill directory or source package checkout when changing the package itself.

- Starting or resuming a recursive-mode run:

  - `/.recursive/STATE.md`
  - `/.recursive/DECISIONS.md`
  - `/.recursive/memory/MEMORY.md`
- Authoring a new recursive-mode spec or `00-requirements.md`:
  - `/.recursive/STATE.md`
  - `/.recursive/DECISIONS.md`
  - `/.recursive/memory/MEMORY.md`
  - the installed `recursive-spec` skill
  - relevant code and tests for the requested area
- Benchmarking recursive-mode against a non-recursive baseline:
  - Install the separate optional `recursive-benchmark` add-on only when the user explicitly asks for benchmarking.
  - Prefer `find-skills` when available; otherwise use `npx skills add <recursive-benchmark-package-or-repo> --full-depth`.
  - The default exported `recursive-mode` package intentionally excludes benchmark fixtures and benchmark skill files.
  - After the benchmark add-on is installed, follow its packaged fixture and harness docs.
- Working on reusable package/bootstrap/docs for this repo:
  - the recursive-mode package README or maintainer notes from the installed skill directory or source package checkout
  - the recursive-mode installer scripts from the installed skill directory or source package checkout
- Working on phase artifact structure or lint expectations:
  - the recursive-mode artifact template from the installed skill directory or source package checkout
  - the recursive-mode lint/status helpers from the installed skill directory or source package checkout
- Working on delegated review, subagent behavior, or routed CLI delegation:
  - `/.recursive/memory/skills/SKILLS.md`
  - `/.recursive/config/recursive-router.json`
  - `/.recursive/config/recursive-router-discovered.json`
  - the installed `recursive-router`, `recursive-subagent`, and `recursive-review-bundle` skills

This file exists only for tools that expect the Codex plans bridge at `/.agent/PLANS.md`.

The canonical workflow specification lives in `/.recursive/RECURSIVE.md`.
Do not maintain a second authoritative workflow here.

If this bridge conflicts with `/.recursive/RECURSIVE.md`, follow `/.recursive/RECURSIVE.md`.

Short user commands that should trigger recursive-mode orchestration include:

- `Implement the run`
- `Implement run <run-id>`
- `Implement requirement '<run-id>'`
- `Implement the plan`
- `Create a new run based on the plan`
- `Start a recursive run`

Resolution rule:

- If a run id is explicit, use that run.
- If exactly one active/incomplete run exists and no run id is given, resume it.
- If the user refers to a plan, create a new run only when a unique source plan/requirements artifact can be identified from repo docs or immediate task context.
- If the command is ambiguous, ask for the run id or the repo path of the source plan/requirements artifact.

Spec-authoring rule:

- If the user asks to create a plan, help plan, create a spec, or write requirements for a new recursive run, prefer `recursive-spec` before orchestration.
- `recursive-spec` should confirm the user wants spec help, ask what they want to do, read `STATE.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, and relevant code/tests, keep the draft in temporary non-repo storage, then create the new run only after the requirements are approved.

Benchmark rule:

- If the user asks to benchmark recursive-mode, compare recursive vs non-recursive execution, or generate a recursive-mode benchmark report, install and use the separate optional `recursive-benchmark` add-on on demand instead of assuming benchmark fixtures ship with the default recursive-mode package.
- Prefer `find-skills` when available. Otherwise use `npx skills add <recursive-benchmark-package-or-repo> --full-depth`.

Audit delegation rule:

- If subagents are available and the audit/review context bundle is complete, delegated audit/review is the default path.
- If the controller still chooses `self-audit`, record a concrete `Delegation Override Reason` in the audited phase artifact.

Router rule:

- If the user asks to route delegated work through another transport/model, configure or inspect `/.recursive/config/recursive-router.json`, refresh `/.recursive/config/recursive-router-discovered.json`, re-read both immediately before choosing the delegated CLI/model, and use `recursive-router` before dispatching the delegated role.
