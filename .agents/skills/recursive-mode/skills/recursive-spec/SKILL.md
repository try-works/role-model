# recursive-spec

Use this skill to co-author a repo-aware `00-requirements.md` for a new recursive-mode run.

This skill is for **requirements/spec authoring before implementation starts**. It does not replace `/.recursive/RECURSIVE.md`, and it should not skip ahead to Phase 2 planning or Phase 3 implementation.

## Primary Use Case

Use `recursive-spec` when the user wants help shaping work before a run exists, especially with prompts like:

- `create a plan`
- `help me plan`
- `create a spec`
- `write requirements`
- `spec this out`
- `scope this`

The important signal is **plan/spec language for a new run**, not implementation of an existing run.

## Conversation Contract

When the trigger is detected:

1. First ask whether the user wants help creating a spec for a recursive run.
2. If the user replies positively, ask: `What do you want to do?`
3. Then gather context, read the repo, and co-author the requirements.

Do not jump straight into writing `00-requirements.md` before the user confirms they want spec help.

## Draft Handling Before Approval

Until the user explicitly approves the spec:

- keep the draft outside the repository worktree
- prefer a temporary session artifact or scratch file
- do **not** create `/.recursive/run/<run-id>/`
- do **not** write `00-requirements.md`

If the user rejects the draft, revise it or discard the temporary draft artifact. Do not leave behind a half-approved run folder.

## Required Read Behavior

Before drafting requirements, read:

1. `/.recursive/STATE.md`
2. `/.recursive/DECISIONS.md`
3. `/.recursive/memory/MEMORY.md`
4. relevant memory shards only when they actually matter
5. the most relevant code and tests for the requested area

The skill should be **repo-aware**, not a blind questionnaire. Use the control-plane docs to understand current truth and the codebase to understand actual surfaces, coupled modules, existing tests, and likely boundaries.

## Authoring Flow

Use a guided interview. Ask one focused question at a time when the answer is not already grounded by repo docs or code.

Recommended sequence:

1. Goal and user outcome
2. Task type: feature, bugfix, refactor, migration, investigation
3. Affected subsystem or files
4. In-scope requirements (`R#`)
5. Observable acceptance criteria for each requirement
6. Edge cases, failure paths, and exclusions
7. Constraints, fixed decisions, and boundaries
8. Open unknowns that must be resolved before Phase 0 is locked

Prefer proposing draft wording and asking the user to confirm or correct it rather than asking the user to author the whole document from scratch.

## Quality Rules

Borrow the strongest authoring ideas from contract-first workflows, but keep the output native to recursive-mode:

- start with user intent and desired outcome
- separate fixed decisions from open questions
- define deterministic, observable acceptance criteria
- include exception and failure-path thinking instead of only the happy path
- make boundaries concrete enough to guide later AS-IS analysis and planning
- keep out-of-scope items explicit

Do **not** introduce a separate `.spec` DSL or a second workflow format.

## Output Contract

The finished output should become:

- `/.recursive/run/<run-id>/00-requirements.md`

Use the repository's native Phase 0 requirements structure:

- keep the scaffolded header from `recursive-init`, including Workflow version: `recursive-mode-audit-v2`
- keep the required `## TODO` section and replace placeholder checklist items rather than deleting the heading
- `## Requirements`
- `## Out of Scope`
- `## Constraints`

Within `## Requirements`, each `R#` should include:

- a short title
- a clear description
- observable acceptance criteria bullets

## Run Creation Rule

Do not create the run folder immediately.

1. Draft and refine the requirements with the user first.
2. Keep the draft in a temporary non-repo artifact until approval.
3. Confirm the user approves the spec and that it is complete enough to proceed.
4. Create the run with `scripts/recursive-init.py` or `scripts/recursive-init.ps1`.
5. Replace the scaffolded `00-requirements.md` with the approved requirements content.

This keeps the run artifact grounded in user-approved requirements instead of half-formed notes.

## Routing Awareness

If spec authoring uses delegated critique, delegated review, or any other external model help to shape the draft, re-read:

- `/.recursive/config/recursive-router.json`
- `/.recursive/config/recursive-router-discovered.json`

immediately before choosing that CLI/model, and route through `recursive-router` instead of inventing an ad hoc model choice.

## Boundaries

- Stay focused on `00-requirements.md` authoring for a new run.
- Do not silently convert this into Phase 2 planning.
- Do not start implementation just because the requirements became clear.
- Do not skip code reading when repository structure matters to scope or constraints.
- Do not create a run until the user-approved spec is ready to write.
- Do not write repository requirements artifacts from an unapproved draft.
