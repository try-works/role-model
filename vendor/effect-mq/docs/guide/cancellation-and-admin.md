# Cancellation & admin

Every admin verb exists twice: typed on the job definition (`MyJob.cancel`, `MyJob.retry`, ...) and definition-free on the `JobStore` service, for dashboards that operate on jobs generically. Both routes go through the store, so lock tokens, attempt accounting, and wake-up notifications stay coherent. Do not mutate job rows directly.

## Cancelling a job

`cancel(id)` behaves by state:

| State | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `waiting` / `delayed` | terminal `cancelled` immediately, with a `cancelled` ledger entry |
| `active` | the store flags `cancelRequested`; the owning worker interrupts the handler fiber on its next heartbeat |
| `waiting-children` | terminal `cancelled` immediately; the settle marks the remaining children in the same atomic op, and the [flow sweeper](/guide/flows#failure-policy) delivers the cancels into their stores |
| terminal | fails with `JobNotCancellableError` |

Because handlers are Effect fibers, cancelling a *running* job interrupts real work: the worker interrupts the fiber, finalizers run, and the worker acks the job `Cancelled`. The flag rides on the lock heartbeat, so cancel latency for running jobs is at most one `lockRenewInterval` (default: half of `lockDuration`, so 15 seconds). Cancellation crosses processes: cancel from your API server, interrupt on the worker machine.

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect"

const admin = Effect.gen(function*() {
  yield* GenerateInvoice.cancel(jobId)
  // waiting/delayed: already terminal. running: interrupted within one heartbeat.
})
```

The driver conformance suite pins two races:

- **Completion wins over a pending cancel.** If the handler finishes before the heartbeat delivers the cancel, the completion ack lands and the job is `completed`; the store never clobbers a result that already exists.
- **Cancel wins over retries.** If the handler fails on its own while a cancel is pending, the store converts the retry ack: the job lands `cancelled` instead of being revived for another attempt.

`awaitResult` treats a cancelled job as a defect (`JobCancelledError`) rather than a typed failure: cancellation is an operator action, outside your error contract.

## Cancel by dedup key

When a job was enqueued under a [dedup key](/guide/deduplication), cancel whatever is pending without tracking job ids:

```ts
const wasPending = yield* SendInvite.cancelByKey(userId)
```

`cancelByKey` is idempotent: it returns `false` when no pending job holds the key, so "cancel it if anything is scheduled" needs no existence check. Pending states follow the same rules as `cancel`: waiting/delayed become terminal, active gets the heartbeat flag.

## Retry and promote

```ts
yield* GenerateInvoice.retry(jobId)     // failed -> waiting, fresh attempt budget
yield* GenerateInvoice.promote(jobId)   // delayed -> waiting now
```

`retry` is the verb behind a dashboard's "retry" button. It moves a `failed` job back to `waiting` with a fresh attempt budget: `attemptsMade` and `stalledCount` reset, and terminal fields clear. The store preserves the attempts ledger and keeps its numbering monotonic, so the first run after a manual retry of a 3-attempt job is attempt 4, not attempt 1. Calling it on a non-failed job fails with `JobNotRetryableError`.

`promote` moves a `delayed` job to `waiting` immediately; any other state fails with `JobNotPromotableError`.

## Pausing queues

Pause lives on the store service. It is durable state that affects every worker on the store, and it survives restarts:

```ts
import { JobStore } from "effect-mq"

const ops = Effect.gen(function*() {
  const store = yield* JobStore.JobStore
  yield* store.pause(JobStore.QueueName("email"))    // claims return empty
  const paused = yield* store.pausedQueues()          // [QueueName("email")]
  yield* store.resume(JobStore.QueueName("email"))   // wakes idle workers immediately
})
```

While a queue is paused, claims return empty but producers are unaffected: enqueues still land, and delayed jobs still promote to `waiting`; the store withholds them from claims. `resume` wakes idle workers immediately rather than waiting for the poll fallback.

## The dashboard data layer

The store is queryable enough to back an ops UI without extra infrastructure. `list` is keyset-paginated, newest first (`enqueuedAt` desc, then id desc) unless you order it:

```ts
const page = yield* store.list({
  queue: JobStore.QueueName("billing"),
  name: "generate-invoice",
  states: ["failed"],
  metadata: { customerId },   // every entry must match exactly (AND semantics)
  limit: 50                   // the default
})
// page.items, plus page.cursor to pass back for the next page

// What runs next:
yield* store.list({
  queue: JobStore.QueueName("billing"),
  states: ["delayed"],
  orderBy: "runAt",
  order: "asc"
})

// What just finished:
yield* store.list({ states: ["completed", "failed"], orderBy: "finishedAt" })
```

`orderBy` takes `enqueuedAt` (the default), `runAt`, or `finishedAt`; `order` takes `asc` or `desc` (default). A cursor is only valid with the options that produced it. Memory and Postgres serve every combination; Redis serves the combinations its structures cover and dies with `ListOrderUnsupportedError` on the rest rather than falling back to a full scan — see [Redis list indexes](/storage/redis#list-indexes).

| Method | Returns |
| --- | --- |
| `list(options)` | a page of `JobRecord`s and a `cursor` when more may exist |
| `counts(queue?)` | live depth: `Record<JobState, number>` |
| `getAttempts(id)` | the raw run ledger, oldest first (empty for unknown ids) |
| `remove(id)` | deletes a job and its ledger; returns `false` for active jobs |

Store-level records carry *encoded* payloads and exits; the typed equivalents live on the definition (`MyJob.poll`, `MyJob.attempts`). On Postgres you can also read the tables directly with drizzle (reads only, no writes); see [Postgres](/storage/postgres).

## Errors

The definition-level verbs surface these as typed failures (`Effect.catchTag`-able); driver failures (`JobStoreError`) become defects there:

| Error | Raised by | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `JobNotFoundError` | `cancel` / `retry` / `promote` | the id does not exist |
| `JobNotCancellableError` | `cancel` | the job is already terminal |
| `JobNotRetryableError` | `retry` | the job is not `failed` |
| `JobNotPromotableError` | `promote` | the job is not `delayed` |
| `JobCancelledError` | `awaitResult` (as a defect) | the awaited job was cancelled |

All are tagged errors exported from the `JobStore` module.
