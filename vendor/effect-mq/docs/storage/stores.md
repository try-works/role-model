# Memory & multiple stores

`MemoryJobStore` is the reference `JobStore` driver: a full implementation of the storage contract that lives in process memory. It passes the same conformance suite as Postgres and Redis, so retries, schedules, dedup, and retention behave identically. It lacks durability and cross-process reach: state disappears on restart, and only workers in the same process can see it.

Use it for tests, demos, and disposable jobs. For anything you'd mind losing, use [Postgres](/storage/postgres) or [Redis](/storage/redis).

## MemoryJobStore

Three constructors, all producing a fresh, empty store per build:

```ts
import { MemoryJobStore } from "effect-mq"

// The default JobStore, no options:
const StoreLive = MemoryJobStore.layer

// With options:
const TunedLive = MemoryJobStore.layerWith({
  historyTtl: { completed: "1 hour", failed: "1 day" },
  historySweepInterval: "30 seconds",
  idGenerator: ({ name }) => `${name}_${crypto.randomUUID()}`
})

// Bound to a named store key instead of the default (see below):
const EphemeralLive = MemoryJobStore.layerFor(Ephemeral, { historyTtl: "1 hour" })
```

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `historyTtl` | off | Retention ceiling for terminal records: one duration for all terminal states, or a per-state split (`{ completed: "1 day", failed: "30 days" }`) |
| `historySweepInterval` | 1 minute | How often the background sweep prunes expired history |
| `idGenerator` | `j-<n>` counter | Generator for store-assigned job ids, sync or Effect-returning |

The history sweeper (when `historyTtl` is set) runs in the layer's scope and also honours stricter per-job [`keep.age` rules](/guide/retention). `MemoryJobStore.make` / `makeWith` return the raw `Service` when you need it outside a layer.

## Named stores

By default every job, producer, and worker shares the single `JobStore` service. Named stores split that into several independent service keys, so different jobs can live on different infrastructure, and the type system routes them:

```ts
import { Job, JobStore } from "effect-mq"
import { Schema } from "effect"

const Durable = JobStore.named("durable")       // -> Postgres in prod
const Ephemeral = JobStore.named("ephemeral")   // -> Redis or memory

class GenerateInvoice extends Job.make("generate-invoice", {
  payload: { invoiceId: Schema.String },
  idempotencyKey: ({ invoiceId }) => invoiceId,
  store: Durable
}) {}

class WarmCache extends Job.make("warm-cache", {
  payload: { key: Schema.String },
  store: Ephemeral
}) {}
```

`JobStore.named("durable")` creates a distinct `Context.Key`. The name string identifies the key, so two `named("durable")` calls in different files are interchangeable. Binding a job with `Job.make(name, { store: Durable })` changes its requirements: `GenerateInvoice.enqueue(...)` now requires the *Durable* store in context instead of the default `JobStore`. Forget to provide the Postgres layer for it and every enqueue site fails to compile.

A **queue** and a **store** are different axes: a queue is an ordering/concurrency domain *within* a store (`Job.make({ queue })`); a store is an infrastructure/durability domain hosting many queues.

## One store, one driver layer

Each driver can construct a layer for a named key. The Postgres layer takes a `store` option; Redis and memory expose `layerFor`:

```ts
import { DrizzleJobStore } from "effect-mq/drizzle-postgres"
import { RedisJobStore } from "effect-mq/redis"
import { MemoryJobStore } from "effect-mq"

const DurableLive = DrizzleJobStore.layer({
  jobs, attempts: jobAttempts, schedules, queues, dedupe,
  store: Durable
})

const EphemeralLive = RedisJobStore.layerFor(Ephemeral)
// ...or, in tests / small deployments:
const EphemeralTest = MemoryJobStore.layerFor(Ephemeral)
```

## Two workers in one process

Workers bind to exactly one store via `Worker.layer({ store })`. To run workers for several stores in the same process, provide each worker layer *locally* to its handler group with `Layer.provide`; a merged global `Worker` would be ambiguous:

```ts
import { Worker } from "effect-mq"
import { Layer } from "effect"

const Workers = Layer.mergeAll(
  GenerateInvoice.toLayer(handleInvoice).pipe(
    Layer.provide(Worker.layer({ store: Durable, concurrency: 4 }))
  ),
  WarmCache.toLayer(handleWarmCache).pipe(
    Layer.provide(Worker.layer({ store: Ephemeral, concurrency: 16 }))
  )
).pipe(Layer.provide(Layer.mergeAll(DurableLive, EphemeralLive)))
```

You can then run business-critical work (invoices, payouts) on Postgres with long retention and high-volume disposable work (cache warming, previews) on Redis or memory with aggressive pruning, all from one codebase with compile-time routing.

::: tip
Producers stay worker-free either way: an API server that enqueues `GenerateInvoice` needs only `DurableLive` in its layer stack, never a `Worker`.

## Metadata vs. your own tables

Two kinds of "business context" belong in two different homes:

- **Operational context**: "list invoice runs for customer X, retry that one". Use the definition's `metadata` projection: a flat `Record<string, string>` derived from the payload, indexed by every driver, filterable via `store.list({ metadata: { customerId } })` or raw SQL on Postgres.
- **Domain history**: "what did this invoice run produce". That belongs in your own tables, joined by the *deterministic* job id from `idempotencyKey`. Because the id is computable from business data, your domain rows can reference queue records without id bookkeeping.

The payoff is lifecycle independence: job [retention](/guide/retention) can prune terminal records because your business history lives in tables you own. Don't let queue infrastructure own business data lifecycles.

## Where to next

- [Postgres](/storage/postgres): the drizzle-schema workflow for the durable store.
- [Redis](/storage/redis): Lua-script atomicity for the fast store.
- [Writing a driver](/storage/writing-a-driver): implement `JobStore` for anything else.
- [Testing your app](/guide/testing): `TestJobStore.layerFor` covers named stores too.
