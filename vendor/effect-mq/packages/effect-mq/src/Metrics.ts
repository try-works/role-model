/**
 * The metrics effect-mq emits, as Effect `Metric` instruments.
 *
 * Metrics are **process-local operational signal, not persisted state**:
 * they live in the Effect metric registry of the emitting process and are
 * exported by whatever exporter the application runs (the Otlp modules from
 * `effect/unstable/observability`, `@effect/opentelemetry`, a Prometheus
 * scraper, ...). Retention belongs to that metrics backend. The queue's
 * *durable* analogues remain in the store — `store.counts()` for live depth
 * and the attempt ledger for per-run history — and stay queryable forever.
 *
 * Producers emit `jobsEnqueued`; workers emit the rest from their loops.
 * Everything is tagged with low-cardinality attributes only (job name,
 * queue, outcome/result) — never ids or keys.
 *
 * This module is exported so applications can read the same instruments
 * (e.g. `Metric.value(Metrics.jobRuns.pipe(Metric.withAttributes({...})))`)
 * or reference the names when building dashboards.
