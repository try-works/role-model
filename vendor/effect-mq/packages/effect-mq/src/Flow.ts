/**
 * Cross-store parent-child flows.
 *
 * A flow's PARENT job fans out N child jobs, parks in `waiting-children`
 * until every child settles, then resumes with their typed results. The
 * children may live on a **different store** than the parent — a
 * cron-scheduled parent in Postgres can fan out thousands of idempotent
 * sends into Redis and collect the outcomes back in Postgres.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const DigestFlow = Flow.make("daily-digest", {
 *   parent: SendDigest,          // a Job bound to the Postgres store
 *   children: [SendEmail],       // Jobs, each bound to their own store
 *   onChildFailure: "continue"   // default; "fail" settles on first failure
 * })
 *
 * // the parent worker runs both phases (requires the parent AND child stores)
 * const DigestWorker = DigestFlow.toLayer({
 *   fanOut: (payload) =>
 *     Effect.gen(function*() {
 *       const users = yield* Users.active
 *       return Flow.children(SendEmail, users.map((user) => ({
 *         key: user.id,
 *         payload: { userId: user.id }
 *       })))
 *     }),
 *   collect: (payload, results) =>
 *     Effect.succeed({ sent: results.counts.completed, failed: results.counts.failed })
 *     // or: yield* results.all (materialized buckets), results.stream (paged)
 * })
 *
 * // workers that run the CHILDREN list the flow so results push instantly:
 * // Worker.layer({ store: EmailStore, flows: [DigestFlow] })
 * ```
 *
 * Architecture (see `designs/parent-child-flows.md`): the parent's store
 * owns the flow — child manifest, per-child results, outcome counters — so
 * "the flow settles exactly once" is single-store atomic. Cross-store needs
 * only two at-least-once idempotent mechanisms: every terminal child
 * transition atomically appends its report to the CHILD store's outbox,
 * which worker relays *push* into the parent store in batches (children
 * keep completing even while the parent store is down); and the parent
 * worker's flow sweeper *reconciles* from child-store state (repairs
 * everything the push path can miss: crashes mid-enqueue, dropped outbox
 * entries, children terminal on stores no relay reaches).
 *
 * Flows nest: a child may itself be another flow's parent, reporting upward
 * through the same machinery when it settles. Depth is capped (8) so a
 * cyclic definition surfaces as an unrecoverable failure instead of an
 * unbounded chain.
 *
 * Flow children bypass the child definition's `idempotencyKey`/`dedupe` —
 * the child `key` (unique within the flow) IS the idempotency mechanism,
 * carried in the deterministic job id. Handlers should be idempotent, as
 * everywhere under at-least-once.
