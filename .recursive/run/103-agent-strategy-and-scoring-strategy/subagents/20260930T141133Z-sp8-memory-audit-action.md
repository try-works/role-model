### Relevant but Untouched

- None

## Claimed Artifact Impact

- `/.recursive/run/103-agent-strategy-and-scoring-strategy/evidence/other/sp8-memory-audit-findings.md`
- `/.recursive/run/103-agent-strategy-and-scoring-strategy/evidence/review-bundles/03-5-code-review-code-reviewer.md`
- `/.recursive/run/103-agent-strategy-and-scoring-strategy/05-manual-qa.md`
- `.recursive/memory/domains/role-model-router.md`

## Claimed Findings
- four CURRENT memory entries are stale after the posture split, three lessons are missing

## Verification Handoff

- The controller should read `.recursive/run/103-agent-strategy-and-scoring-strategy/evidence/other/sp8-memory-audit-findings.md`, apply the recommended edits to the five memory files, and re-read `.recursive/run/103-agent-strategy-and-scoring-strategy/08-memory-impact.md` against them.
